# Hi, I'm Ujwal Panday! 👋

I'm a passionate MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) developer with a strong focus on building full-stack applications that are efficient, scalable, and user-friendly. Alongside my development work, I am also deeply invested in improving my problem-solving skills through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## 🌟 What I Do

- **MERN Stack Development**: I love creating dynamic and responsive web applications using the MERN stack. From designing intuitive user interfaces with React.js to building robust backends with Node.js and Express, I enjoy every step of the development process.

- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: To sharpen my problem-solving skills and to ensure that my code is not just functional but also optimized, I regularly practice DSA. I enjoy solving problems on various platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Postman, npm, Webpack
- **Other**: RESTful APIs, JSON, JWT Authentication, Responsive Design

## 🌱 What I'm Currently Learning

- Advanced React concepts (Hooks, Context API, etc.)
- TypeScript for type safety in JavaScript
- GraphQL for efficient data querying
- In-depth Data Structures & Algorithms

## 🎓 Education

- **Bachelor's in Computer Science**: Currently pursuing my degree, deepening my understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science.
